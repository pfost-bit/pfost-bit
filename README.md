# Hi, I'm Patrick Foster 

**Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Surfer/Climber/OutDoors Enthusiast**

I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, from humanitarian AI to domain-specific language models. Currently, pursuing graduate studies in Data Science with a focus on machine learning applications.

##  What I Do

I specialize in:
- **Machine Learning & NLP:** Fine-tuning LLMs, prompt engineering, domain adaptation
- **Computer Vision:** Vision Transformers, transfer learning, multi-scale inference, object detection
- **Statistical Analysis:** Advanced modeling, hypothesis testing, multivariate analysis
- **Data Engineering:** API integration, web scraping, ETL pipelines
- **Geospatial ML:** Aerial imagery analysis for disaster response and humanitarian applications
